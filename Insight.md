# Insight

Interacting with the supernatural world can give an Initiate a measure of __insight__. Insight can be used to develop the Mage's powers over time, but also to gain short term benefits. 

Insight is a binary condition: either you have it or not. If you were to gain insight again, while you already have it, you may spend the previous insight right then, so the new one isn't wasted. You may also spend insight at any time. Once spent, you don't have it anymore until you gain it again. 

Uses for insight:
  * Empower your next spell: if you roll less than 7 it counts as 7, if your roll 7 or more it counts as 10.
  * Obtain a Fate, only if you have less than 3 active Fates.
