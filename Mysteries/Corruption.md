# Corruption

Corruption is a term used by many Mages to refer to errors or mistakes made when using their Magic. 
A Mage realizes their magic has been Corrupted if the resulting effect was not what they wished for, usually for the worse. 

The effect of Corruption on a spell can go from merely annoying to life ruining, so Mentors usually teach their Apprentices to be methodical and careful with their Magic, to prevent it as much as possible.

Initiates that embrace Corruption and invite it at every turn are almost universally reviled by civilized Mages.
Many of them are hunted down and executed by their peers.
