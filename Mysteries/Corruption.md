# Corruption

Corruption is a term used by many Mages to refer to errors or mistakes made when using their Magic. 
A Mage realizes their magic has been Corrupted if the resulting effect was not what they wished for, usually for the worse. 

The effect of Corruption on a spell can go from merely annoying to life ruining, so Mentors usually teach their Apprentices to be methodical and careful with their Magic, to prevent it as much as possible.

Initiates that embrace Corruption and invite it at every turn are almost universally reviled by civilized Mages.
Many of them are hunted down and executed by their peers. 

## Handling Corruption

When __a 6 or less is rolled when using Magic__, the MC chooses one of the following Corruption effects to take place.
Do not read out the name of the effect, just describe how it appears to the Initiates.

### Psychic Feedback

Something in your surroundings is resonating with your magic, producing a negative feedback. 
The source may or may not be clear, but it negates the effect of your spell and, while you remain close to the source, you __take -1 to your rolls__ in every future attempt to cast a spell.
The MC decides what the source of this resonance is.

### Excesive Force

The results of your magic come stronger than intended. 
The MC chooses some aspect of the spell and intensifies it beyond the Mage's expectations.

_For example, a spell intended to put one person to sleep sends them into a coma, a punch powered by magic ends up killing the victim rather than just incapacitating them, a small fire meant to burn a book extends to an entire room, etc._
