# Elemental Spirits

Elementals, or Elemental Spirits, are ephemeral entities embodied in natural phenomena such as rain, lightning, fire, wind, trees, etc. 
These entities have very simple drives and agendas: they are whatever they intend and viceversa. 

_For example, a fire wants to burn everything in its way, a wind wants to blow and knock everything over, a heavy rain wants to pour its heart out, and so on._

## Spirit Magic

An Initiate can use __Revelation__ to discover the spirit at the core of these natural forces and comunicate with them. 

Even if the spirit hasn't been revealed, __Power Word__ can be used to try and command their behavior. 
When dealing with these spirits, they will usually agree to any pact that involves allowing them to do what they already want to do.

Some Mages use pacts to trap such spirits to power magical artifacts, such as a _Flying Staff_ or _Flaming Wand_ (see the Animation Formulae for details on such constructions). 

__Word of warning__: any magical object housing a spirit that is ignored for a long time will seek to get itself into the hands of someone who will want to use it, which usually has dangerous consequences.
Responsible Mages will use __Binding__ to seal these items in secure chambers where they can't be found by the uninitiated.

## Spirit Courts

All spirits belonging to the same class of phenomena are said to belong to a Court. 
When another entity interacts with one of these spirits in a meaningful way, the interaction can make an impression on the whole Court. 

_For example, all fire spirits can remember if a Mage promised or demanded something from other fire spirits or viceversa._
_This means that over time, a Mage can form a reputation with the Courts._

## Artificial Spirits

Manufactured objects do not contain full elementals, only spiritual traces of the natural elements used and consumed in their construction. 
However, as the objects are used, this spiritual energy can realign itself into new, unique entities. 
When an object contains such a spirit, it can be revealed and commanded in the same way an elemental can.
