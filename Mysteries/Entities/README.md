# Entities

There are many kinds of mysterious entities to be found. 
This section contains examples of the most common, and a few others that I found interesting.

## Rank

Some Entities are more powerful than others. 
To compare their relative potential in a simple way, each entity is asigned a Rank that goes from 0 to 5.

* Rank 0: Passive entities that have little or no agency.
* Rank 1: Entities with the average agency and skill of a human.
* Rank 2: Superhuman entities with alien minds and powers.
* Rank 3: Overseers, champions, imposing spiritual presences.
* Rank 4: Demigods, avatars and emisaries of divinities. 
* Rank 5: The Gods themselves. Beyond even Mage comprehension.

When __Power Word__ or __Binding__ are used against an Entity with Rank, __take -X in the roll__, where X is their Rank.
