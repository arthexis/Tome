# Temporal Scrying

The Initiate can glimpse the future or past of a subject.

1. Every subject in the universe has sympathy to all previous versions of themselves in the past and all potential futures. 
Begin by using __Revelation__ on the subject to know the exact moment of their timeline that you want to scry on. 

1. Use __Binding__ and choose to scry upon the past or future version that you have revealed. 
This only allows visualizing the subject and not comunicating with it, since the thing the Mage is just seeing a mirage.

1. While glimpsing a past or future, it is possible to use __Occultation__ to hide the event from further scrying.
The Initiate can even craft an illusion to replace the event.

1. Also while glimpsing, the Mage can use __Revelation__ on the mirage to ask questions about it. 
The MC answers these questions from the perspective of the subject in the past or future.


## Postcognition

Postcognition is the use of temporal scrying to see the past. 
Unless something supernatural is going on, the past tends to be a fixed thing. 
If the subject being scryed has changed so much over time that it no longer has sympathy to its past self, additional magic may be required to recreate the sympathy before it can be used. 


## Precognition

Precognition is the use of temporal scrying to see the future.
When seeing the future, the Initiate contemplates the most possible future based on present events. 
If things change significantly in the present, the next time the subject is scryed upon may present different results. 
Sometimes, very minor things can produce mayor changes, which keeps some events in the future unpredictable, even for a Mage.
