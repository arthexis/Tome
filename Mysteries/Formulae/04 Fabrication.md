# Fabrication

The Initiate creates a complex device or creature out of simple materials.
This Formulae can only craft devices or creatures that could exist normally, with no supernatural powers of their own. 

1. Cast __Revelation__ on an object or creature that you want to replicate, to understand how it works. 

1. Cast __Channelling__ to give yourself the skill to assemble and dissasemble this specific structure quickly and precisely.
This effect ends automatically when the fabrication is complete.

1. Assemble the materials and cast __Binding__ on them, increasing the sympathy between the components to keep them magically together. 

1. Cast __Occultation__ to wrap the resulting object or device, so it appears and behaves normally. 


When completed, the fabricated object will appear and behave exactly as the desired device. 
If the object or the illusion that wraps it are destroyed, the object will crumble down into the original materials used by the Initiate. 


## Simulacra

Living creatures created with this Formulae are called _Simulacra_. 
These false creatures behave as a typical member of their species, having all the expected instincts and behaviors, except they don't actually eat, drink or reproduce. 
They don't have a complex mind either, but one can be implanted by casting __Animation__ on them.
