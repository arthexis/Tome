# Fabrication

The Initiate can quickly assemble or modify devices or objects of all kinds, using basic components or by dissasembling similar objects.

1. The subject of this rite is either an existing object or device, or most of the components that would make one up. 
Start by casting __Revelation__ on the subject to perfectly understand how it works.

1. Use __Channelling__ to give yourself the skill to assemble and/or dissasemble the object quickly. 
Thanks to the Revelation, you can perfectly tune yourself to this task.

1. As you perform the task, use __Binding__ to increase the sympathy between all the components.
This speeds up the process and ensures the final object will work flawlessly on the first try.

The magic of this rite automatically adjusts or transforms the components in minor ways as required to make them fit. 
No special tools are required either: the Initiate can perform the task with their bare hands. 

Simple objects and devices can be built in seconds. 
Large vehicles or machines may be build over the course of a day. 
This Formulae is useful for constructing vessels that can be used for __Animation__.
