# Transmutation

The Initiate can transform a substance or humor into a different one. 

1. This Formulae works on any kind of "substance" whether its rock, metal, wood, flesh and psychic substances such as anger, joy or fear. 
However, a physical thing can only be transformed into another physical thing, and a psychic thing can only be transformed into another psychic thing.
Cast __Channelling__ to allow yourself to manipulate the subject safely.

2. Inject energy into the subject. This can be done by casting __Channeling__ upon the subject and transfering elemental energy and a sample of the desired substance.
Elemental energy cand be obtained from a magical or natural source such as heat, electricity, vibrations, spirits, etc. 

3. Cast __Binding__ to remove any impure sympathies that the final substance shouldn't have. 
As you do so, sift, blend, stirr and mold your subject to the desired shape.

4. Instead of working on the subject directly, the Mage can produce an alchemical elixir that will activate the transformation when consumed by another subject. The elixir holds its own power, so __Channelling__ is not needed to consume it.

The result will be an object made out of single substance. 
However, the substance doesn't need to be a single element, it can be a complex organic or psychic substance. 


## Alchemical Elixirs

One of the benefits of Alchemical Elixirs is that they are essentially a bottled up spell, but they can only afect the subject by transforming them in some way. 
After being created, elixirs have a short shelf life of about one day. 
Their life can be extended by storing the potion in a container enchanted with a __Binding__ spell to seal its magic. 

### Flesh to Stone

When this elixir is consumed, the victim turns to stone over the course of a minute. 
Traditionally, the resulting material is granite or limestone and the resulting object shows no signs of being anything other than a statue.
If the effect is somehow reversed, the subject can be revived to a perfectly normal state, no matter how much time passed.

### Immortality Blood

The special component required by this elixir is vampire's blood, though some Mages have managed to replicate the effect by using ground leeches, mercury and fresh menses. 
Upon imbibing the elixir, the subject's flesh becomes undead, but retains their mind and soul. 
After 24 hours, the effect reverts unless another dose of the elixir is consumed. 

In this state, they don't need to breathe, drink or feed on anything except blood (though unlike a real vampire, they don't need to consume blood to sustain their powers, they can still use magic).
While the sun does not burn a Mage in this state, its light is blinding and its warmth makes the body feel lethargic.
