# Time Travelling

The Initiate can visit their own past and future and even alter the timeline. 

1. This Formulae sends only the Mage's consciousness across time, to inhabit their own bodies at the past or future. 
Cast __Binding__ to tune into a version of your past or future self that you want to blink into.

1. Cast __Channelling__ to perform astral proyection, but send your mind and soul along the connection to your past or future. 
A special component is required for this rite: a __Consecrated__ working clock showing the time that you are travelling to.

1. As you feel your consciousness reaching its destination, cast __Binding__ to anchor yourself to your body. 
You will remain in the past or future as long as this effect isn't dispelled.
