# Formulae: Spirit Binding

The Initiate can bind an ephemeral entity to a material vessel. 

1. Before the rite begins, access to both the entity and vessel is needed. 
If the entity isn't present, it must be summoned first (see Formulae 2 Summoning).

1. If the entity is unwilling, __Power Word__ needs to be used first, to command or contract the entity into submission. 
Entities can be willing if the Mage let's the control the vessel, and tend to resist otherwise.

1. If the vessel already has an entity controlling it, it must be suppressed first by using __Power Word__. 
While the new entity controls the vessel, its original entity cannot exits its deep slumber.

1. Turn the material vessel into an anchor for the entity by using __Bind Together__ and making the magical sympathy between permanent. 

1. If the entity doesn't have the power to animate the vessel, use __Empty Body__ on the vessel to infuse it with vitality. 
A special component such as human blood or high voltage electricity is required.

__Unraveling__: The entire effect can be unravelled by using __Snap Appart__ on the magical connection between the entity and vessel.

## Revenants

A Revenant is a corpse that has been reanimated using supernatural powers, this Formulae for example, by infusing it with its own ghost. 
This kind of undead has greater power than typical zombies, as they retain their memories and skills.
