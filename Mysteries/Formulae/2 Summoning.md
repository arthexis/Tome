# 2 Summoning

The Initiate summons another entity to their presence.

1. If the entity you wish to summon is ephemeral, use __Empty Body__ to allow your body to interact with it.

1. If the entity is in another realm, you need to be near a Threshold leading into that realm. 
The Threshold must be open for the Summoning to work.

1. If the entity is not in the vicinity, you need to have some magical sympathy to it. 
Some entities posses a Secret Name that can be uttered instead. 
Either way, use __Bind Together__ to affect the entity with your next Magic. 

1. Use __Power Word__ to request an audience with the entity, or simply command it to appear in your presence. 


### Magic Circles

Before attempting a Summoning, a Mage can create a magic circle to contain the entity. 
As the circle is drawn, use __Snap Apart__ to cleanse the space within of all magical sympathy.
