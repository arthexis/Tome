# Formulae: Animation

The Initiate binds an ephemeral entity to a material vessel, animating it.

1. Before the rite begins, access to both the entity and vessel is needed. 
If the entity isn't present, use __Summoning__ to bring it forth.

1. If the vessel already has an entity controlling it, it must be suppressed by using __Power Word__. 
While the new entity controls the vessel, its original entity cannot exits its deep slumber.

1. If the entity is unwilling, __Power Word__ needs to be used, to command or contract the entity. 
Entities can be willing if the Mage allows them control of the vessel, and tend to resist otherwise.

1. Turn the material vessel into an anchor for the entity by using __Binding__ and making the magical sympathy between permanent. 

1. If the entity doesn't have the power to animate the vessel, use __Channeling__ on the vessel to infuse it with vitality. 
A special component such as human blood or high voltage electricity is required.

## Revenants

A Revenant is a corpse that has been reanimated using supernatural powers, this Formulae for example, by infusing it with its own ghost. 
This kind of undead has greater power than typical zombies, as they retain their memories and skills.
