# Formulae: Animation

The Initiate binds an ephemeral entity to a material vessel, animating it.

1. Before the rite begins, access to both the entity and vessel is needed. 
If the entity isn't present, use __Summoning__ to bring it forth.

1. If the vessel already has an entity controlling it, it must be suppressed by using __Power Word__. 
While the new entity controls the vessel, its original entity cannot exits its deep slumber.

1. If the entity is unwilling, __Power Word__ needs to be used, to command or contract the entity. 
Entities can be willing if the Mage allows them control of the vessel, and tend to resist otherwise.

1. Turn the material vessel into an anchor for the entity by using __Binding__ and making the magical sympathy between permanent. 

1. If the entity doesn't have the power to animate the vessel, use __Channeling__ on the vessel to infuse it with vitality. 
A special component such as human blood or high voltage electricity is required.


## Elementals

Elemental spirits can be found everywhere, as the animating force underlying many natural phenomena. 
Fire, wind and electricity are common examples that can bound into objects using __Animation__ to produce different effects.

Once bound, their owner establishes a set of secret phrases that allow them to activate or deactive the item's powers.
These can also be forced by using __Power Word__ even if the secret phrase is unknown.

### Flying Staves

A very common creation amongst Mages: by binding a wind elemental spirit into an object and making a pact with it, the object can fly through the air and be used as a method of transportation. 
Flying brooms, staves and capes are common examples of these creations.

### Elemental Wands

Another common creation used as a weapon: by trapping an elemental in some kind of weapon or wand, often into an Object of Power, the resulting object can be used to conjure elemental energy as an attack. 
The type of energy conjured depends on the spirit bound within. 

### Rank and Charges

The Rank of the elemental powering a magical object determines how often it can be used, as each activation consumes part of the essence inside the trapped spirit. 

* Rank 1 items can be activated once per week.
* Rank 2 items can be activated once per day.
* Rank 3 items can be activated once per hour.
* Rank 4 items can be activated once per minute.
* Rank 5 items can be activated any time.

Naturally, highly Ranked spirits are extremely difficult to bind in this manner.

### Exquisite Crafting

Binding a spirit to create a magical item works better when the item has been crafted for that specific purpose, by the hand of the Mage themselves. 
The more exquisite and personalized the item is, the better. 

* If it took hours to craft, take +1 to the roll.
* If it took days and rare materials to craft, take +2 to the roll.
* If it took months and unique materials to craft, take +3 to the roll.


## Revenants

A Revenant is a corpse that has been reanimated using supernatural powers, this Formulae for example, by infusing it with its own ghost. 
This kind of undead has greater power than typical zombies, as they retain their memories and skills. 
If they were Mages, they lose their ability to work Magic, but not their knowledge of it.

Revenants still require an anchor aside their own corpses to sustain themselves, their anchor needs to be something connecting them to the world of the living, or it won't work.

### Lichdom

A few Mages feel the temptation to cheat death by turning themselves into Revenants before old age can kill them. 
Hower, most such Mages also desire to preserve their magical talents in their new undead form, which doesn't normally happen. 
This requires a more complex and dangerous version of the Animation ritual, known as the Phylactery Lichdom. 
In this dark ritual, the Mage binds their own Soul in a _phylactery_, a special gem they must carry at all times.
