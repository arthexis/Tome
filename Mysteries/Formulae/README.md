# Formulae

A Formula is a series of steps, requiring the casting of specific spells and specific components, to achieve a powerful result. 
These effects can be more complex than those accomplished only with the basic spells of the Four Principia.

All Mages can use Formulae, even if they haven't studied them. 
In fact, it is possible for an Initiate to rediscover a Formulae on their own, not knowing it has already been invented.
However, there is a benefit to practicing.

## Trained Formulae

Each Initiate can choose 2 Formulae at the start of the game and mark them as __trained__ on their log. 
Being trained carries the following benefits:

* You know all the steps and required components by memory.

* If the Formulae requires multiple rolls, you can choose to do a single roll after performing all the required rites. 
This role is made using the lowest Principia from those required by the Formulae. 

* If you have time, resources and a safe place, you can refine the ritual to __take +1 to the roll__.


## Untrained Formulae

Formulae can be used by reading them off a Grimoire, or being instructed in their use by a mentor. 
Any Mage that is trained in a Formulae can teach it to others. 
However, this is often not done for free: most mentors demand something in return.

Using a Formulae doesn't mean you are __trained__ on it, you will require a lot of practice before that.
This is represented by __spending an advancement__.


## Formulae Creation

The Formulae listed in this section is just an example of what can be created, but the players should work with ther MCs to create new Formulae if the existing ones don't cover their needs.
