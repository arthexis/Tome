# Using Formulae

All Mages can use Formulae, even if they haven't studied them. 
In fact, it is possible for a Mage to rediscover a Formulae on their own, not knowing it has already been invented.
However, there is a benefit to practicing them rather than improvising.

## Trained Formulae

Each Initiate can choose 2 Formulae at the start of the game and mark them as __trained__ on their log. 
Being trained carries the following benefits:

* You know all the steps and required components by memory.

* If the Formulae requires multiple rolls, you can choose to do a single roll after performing all the required rites. 
This role is made using the lowest Principia from those required by the Formulae. 

* If you have time, resources and a safe place, you can refine the ritual to __take +1 to the roll__.


## Untrained Formulae

These can be used by reading them off a Grimoire, or being instructed in their use by a mentor. 
Any Mage that is trained in a Formulae can teach it to others. 
However, this is often not done for free: most mentors demand something valuable in return.

Using a Formulae doesn't mean you are __trained__ on it, you will require a lot of practice before that.
This is represented by __spending an advancement__.
