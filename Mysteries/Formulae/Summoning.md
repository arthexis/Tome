# Summoning

The Initiate summons another entity to their presence.

1. Before attempting a Summoning, you can create a magic circle to contain the entity. 

1. If the entity is in another realm, you need to be near a Threshold leading into that realm. 
The Threshold must be open for the Summoning to work.

1. If the entity is not in the vicinity, you need to have sympathy to it or use its __Secret Name__. 
Use __Binding__ to affect the entity with your next magic. 

1. Use __Power Word__ to request an audience with the entity, or simply command it to appear. 
Because the entity is not present yet, a sacrament _must_ be used.

1. If you used a magic circle, use __Binding__ as it appears to Seal it inside the circle.
Otherwise, use this Move to give it an anchor.

The entity that has been summoned does not obey the Mage beyond having to stay in there with them or leaving when dismissed.
If the Mage wants to request its help, or compel it to do something, they can negotiate or use __Power Word__.


## Ghost Summoning

A ghost is a dead human soul that remains in the material plane rather than going to the beyond.
Their unresolved businesses determine what objects, places or persons can become their anchors.
In addition to those, a ghost continues to have symapathy with its mortal remains.

If the soul has already departed for the beyond, it can be summoned only at a Treshold to the Underworld.
