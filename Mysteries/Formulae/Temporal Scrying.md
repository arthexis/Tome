# Temporal Scrying

The Initiate can glimpse the future or past of a subject.

1. Every subject in the universe has sympathy to all previous versions of themselves in the past and all potential futures. 
Begin by using __Revelation__ on the subject to know the exact moment of their timeline that you want to scry on. 

2. Use __Binding__ and choose to scry upon the past or future version that you have revealed. 
This only allows visualizing the subject and not comunicating with it or using further magic, since the thing the Mage is seeing is basically a mirage: an echo that doesn't exist anymore or just a future posibility.
