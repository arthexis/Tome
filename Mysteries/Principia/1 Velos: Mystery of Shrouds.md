# Velos: The Mystery of Shrouds

__Trait__: Unseen Sense. __Spells:__ Revelation, Occultation

The Mystery of Shrouds teaches us that everything perceived is veiled by myriad illusions. 
Indeed, our Mind's Eye has evolved not to operate on the Recondite Truth of objective reality, but upon the ilusions themselves. 
Some of these can dispelled by the tools of science and rationality, but others cannot be dispelled without proper knowledge of the Arcane Mysteries.

Any Initiate to this Mystery can use their intuition to discern aspects of the truth hidden under these Shrouds or _Velos_. 
With the proper rite, the Shrouds can be removed... or new Veils laid down to obscure the perception of the uninitiated.

### Mysteries cannot be Unseen

This applies to all Mysteries, but specially to the Shrouds: once something has been revealed, the Initiate cannot help but see the truth from then on, a magus never falls for the same illusion twice. 
Once an invisible thing is known, the Magus is unable to stop seeing its realm form, even if they want to.


## Trait: Unseen Sense

When __the supernatural is afoot__, even if you are unable to perceive it normally, your Soul feels it. 
The MC might ask you a question that you must answer truthfully, and then tells you what you sense and how.
If you have encountered this phenomenon in the past, the MC tells you that as well. 


## Spell: Revelation

When you __perform a revelation rite__, __roll +Velos__. 
__On a 7+__, the MC answers one question of your choice with a true and useful answer.
__On a 10+__, you can make one or two follow up questions, or ask to receive a vision. 

* Where is something hidden in here?
* What is here that cannot be perceived?
* Who here is being deceitful?
* How does this thing work?
* When did something happen here?

__On a miss__, ask one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

If you ask a question not on the list, the MC can choose to answer it anyways or choose one of the options that is the closest to your question and answer that instead.

### Revelation Rites

The following are common revelation rites:

* Looking at something through a crystal, lens or reflection.
* Praying to a higher power for insight or wisdom.
* Interpreting signs and omens in natural phenomena. 
* Consulting the results of a game of chance.

### Mystical Visions

Sometimes using the Veils simply reveals discrete bits of information. 
Other times, the mind of the Initiate is sent through a complex vision: a short scene in which the Mage experiences the truth firsthand. 
With experience or luck, a Mage learns to trigger these visions almost at will. 
At any time, the Mage can snap out of the vision if desired. 

On the other hand, visions can also be accidentally triggered by Corruption. 
When this happens, the Mage cannot control the vision or snap out of it without outside intervention. 

### Revealing Ephemerals

Emphemeral entities, such as ghosts, spirits, angels and psychic projections are by their nature invisible and intangible. 
Once revealed through this Mystery, an Entity is no longer hidden from the Initiate and can be perceived and affected by any Magic they can use upon things that they can perceive, though they remain physically intangible.

### Revealing Thresholds

This Mystery can reveal the Initiate the presence of a Threshold: a portal to another realm or state of existence. 
By asking how the Threshold works, the Magus can learn to use it to cross over to that other realm or state. 
However, they cannot learn anything from what lies on the other side until they have experienced that realm or state at least once. 


## Spell: Occultation

When you __performing an occultation rite__ on yourself or another subjet, __roll +Velos__. 
__On a hit__, choose one or two options:

* Its appearance changes to something that is somewhat similar.
* Others avoid paying attention to it, if they are able.
* It leaves no tracks or record of its passing.

__On a 10+__, the illusion is very precise. 
__On a 7+__, the illusion has a flaw chosen by the MC. 
__On a miss__, choose one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

### Occultation Rites

The following are common occultation rites:

* Hiding the subject under a veil or inside an opaque container.
* Use smoke, dust, fog, shadows or lights to obscure the subject.
* Burying something or destroying evdicence of the subject's existence.
* Have the subject don a mask, costume and/or apply makeup.

### Handling Illusions

An illusion created by this Mystery effects all human senses. 
It triggers the __Unseen Sense__ of other Initiates when they are in its presence. 
For everybody else, the illusion is perfectly believable and they will try to rationalize it as best as they can. 
If believing it is impossible, possibly because it has a flaw and it has been noticed, the illusion is dispelled. 

Anyone who witnesses the moment when an illusion is created or dispelled, quickly forgets about it and carries on with their life, simply accepting whatever new thing is presented to their senses as if it had always been there.

### Illusion Flaws

These are some common illusion flaws:

* Small children and animals see through the illusion.
* The illusion doesn't reflect on mirrors or leaves no shadow.
* The movements of the illusion appear glitchy or unnatural.

When an illusion has a flaw and __Revelation__ is used on it, __take +1__ on that roll.
