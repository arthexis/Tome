# Copas: Mystery of Vessels

The Mystery of Vessels teaches us that everything is conduit and container for the unseen forces of the universe. 
Living things, machines, magical constructs, everything is powered, directed and animated by invisible energies that are unable to exist by themselves without these Vessels that hold them.

An Initiate to this Mystery can sense when an action they are about to take is dangerous, hurtful or impossible in their current state. With the appropriate rite, they can empower and attune their body to make the task possible and safe, or force their own Soul to briefly leave their body to explore the Mysteries unhindered.

This Mystery usually only affects the Initiate using it, and not anyone else. 


## Move: Sense the Ripple

When you are about to __attempt an action that could hurt you or is bound to fail__, the MC tells you. 
You can then choose a different course of action, such as performing a quick rite (using any Principia, not only Vessels). 

This Move also triggers when something external is going to hurt, change or bind the Initiate, so that they always have one chance to use a quick rite in response. 


## Move: Hone the Vessel

When you __need to be stronger, faster, smarter or thoughter__ and you perform an _enhancement rite_, __roll +Copas__.
__On a 7+__, choose one benefit that lasts for a scene.
__On a 10+__, you can choose two benefits at once. 

* You become skilled in a task, such as playing an instrument, hacking, picking locks, juggling, etc.
* You can jump, throw or run a long distance in a short time, better than any athlete.
* You become resistant to something that would harm, change or bind you.
* You obtain a supernatural ability from a component used in the enhancement rite.

__On a miss__, choose one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

### Enhancement Rites

The following are common enhancement rites:

* Imbibing a substance that alters your perception or state of mind.
* Preparing and consuming something a ceremonial meal. 
* Performing some manner of ritual purification of the body.
* Completing a kata, mantra, dance, breathing excercise or similar.
* Don a sacred outfit or costume and wield purified or consacrated tools.


### Supernatural Abilities

This Mystery will not grant the Initiate supernatural abilities unless special specific components are used in the rite. 
These special components, that are very often supernatural in origin, can be discovered through trial and error or learned from Grimoires and Masters. 
Once a component is discovered, you may write it down so that you can use it in the future.


## Move: Empty the Vessel

When you attempt to __proyect yourself out of your body__, by performing a _meditation rite_, __roll +Copas__. 
__On a 7+__, your Soul leaves your unconscious body as an ephemeral entity, but stays anchored to it until you return. 
__On a 10+__, you also retain some awareness of the surroundings of your body.

__On a miss__, something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

### Meditation Rites

The following are common meditation rites:

* Meditating in a silent and dark place. 
* Overloading your senses through ecstatic experience.
