# Copas: Mystery of Vessels

The Mystery of Vessels teaches us that everything is conduit and container for the unseen forces of the universe. 
Living things, machines, magical constructs, everything is powered, directed and animated by invisible energies that are unable to exist by themselves without these Vessels that hold them.

An Initiate to this Mystery can sense when an action they are about to take is dangerous, hurtful or impossible in their current state. With the appropriate rite, they can empower and attune their body to make the task possible and safe, or force their own Soul to briefly leave their body to explore the Mysteries unhindered.


## Move: Mage Time

When something in your vicinity __will hinder or endanger you__, the MC tells you what's going to happen. 
If you don't like that result, you may perform one rite just in time to change the outcome.

This effect is always active.


## Move: Empty Body

When you perform an __embodiment rite__ upon yourself or another subject, __roll +Copas__.
__On a 7+__, gain or grant one benefit for an hour.
__On a 10+__, you can gain or grant two benefits at once, or one benefit for one day. 

* Become skilled in a task, such as playing an instrument, hacking, picking locks, juggling, etc.
* Become able to jump, throw or run a long distance in a short time, better than any athlete.
* Become resistant to something that would harm, change or bind the subject.
* Obtain a supernatural ability from a component used in the enhancement rite.
* Perform astral projection or physically interact with ephemeral entities.

__On a miss__, choose one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.


### Embodiment Rites

The following are common embodiment rites:

* Imbibe a substance that alters your perception or state of mind.
* Prepare and consuming something a ceremonial meal. 
* Perform some manner of ritual purification of the body.
* Complete a kata, mantra, dance, breathing excercise or similar.
* Meditate on a secluded, tranquil, dark space.
* Don a sacred outfit or costume and wield purified or consacrated tools.


### Supernatural Abilities

This Mystery will not grant the Initiate supernatural abilities unless specific components are used in the rite. 
These special components, that are very often supernatural in origin, can be discovered through trial and error or learned from Grimoires and Masters. 
Once a component is discovered, you may write it down so that you can use it in the future.

### Astral Projection

When you perform Astral Projection, your Mind and Soul exit your body and behave like an ephemeral entity. 
Your body goes limp and enters a state of suspended animation while your Mind continues to sense the material plane around it, with your body serving as an anchor.
Your projection can levitate and go through solid surfaces in the material plane.

You can also choose to project to other nearby realms, such as the Astral planes which can be entered anywhere a Mind exists.
