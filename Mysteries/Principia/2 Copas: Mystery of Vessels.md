# Copas: Mystery of Vessels

The Mystery of Vessels teaches us that everything is conduit and container for the unseen forces of the universe. 
Living things, machines, magical constructs, everything is powered, directed and animated by invisible energies that are unable to exist by themselves without these Vessels that hold them.

An Initiate to this Mystery can sense when an action they are about to take is dangerous, hurtful or impossible in their current state. With the appropriate rite, they can empower and attune their body to make the task possible and safe, or force their own Soul to briefly leave their body to explore the Mysteries unhindered.


## Move: Forked Path 

When you are about to __attempt an action that could hurt you or is bound to fail__, the MC tells you that and gives you a choice: go ahead and suffer the consequences or take a different course of action, such as performing a quick rite (you can use any of the Four Principia, not only Vessels). 

This Move also triggers when something external is going to hurt, change or bind the Initiate, so that they always have one chance to use their Magic before danger reaches them. 


## Move: Empty Body

When you __need to be stronger, faster, smarter or thoughter__ and you perform an _embodiment rite_, __roll +Copas__.
__On a 7+__, choose one benefit that lasts until you end it or try to gain a different one.
__On a 10+__, you can choose two benefits at once. 

* You become skilled in a task, such as playing an instrument, hacking, picking locks, juggling, etc.
* You can jump, throw or run a long distance in a short time, better than any athlete.
* You become resistant to something that would harm, change or bind you.
* You obtain a supernatural ability from a component used in the enhancement rite.
* You can perform astral projection or physically interact with ephemeral entities.

__On a miss__, choose one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

If the rite is performed upon another body, and not the Initiate's, that other body can receive the benefits.

### Embodiment Rites

The following are common embodiment rites:

* Imbibing a substance that alters your perception or state of mind.
* Preparing and consuming something a ceremonial meal. 
* Performing some manner of ritual purification of the body.
* Completing a kata, mantra, dance, breathing excercise or similar.
* Meditating on a secluded, tranquil, dark space.
* Don a sacred outfit or costume and wield purified or consacrated tools.


### Supernatural Abilities

This Mystery will not grant the Initiate supernatural abilities unless special specific components are used in the rite. 
These special components, that are very often supernatural in origin, can be discovered through trial and error or learned from Grimoires and Masters. 
Once a component is discovered, you may write it down so that you can use it in the future.

### Astral Projection

When you perform Astral Projection, your Mind and Soul exit your body and behave like an ephemeral entity. 
Your body goes limp and enters a state of suspended animation while your Mind continues to sense the material plane around it, with your body serving as an anchor.
Your projection can levitate and go through solid surfaces in the material plane.
You can also choose to project to other nearby realms, such as the Astral planes which can be entered anywhere a Mind exists.
