# Copas: Mystery of Vessels

__Trait:__ Mage Time. __Spell:__ Channelling

The Mystery of Vessels teaches us that everything is conduit and container for the unseen forces of the universe.
Living things, machines, magical constructs, everything is powered, directed and animated by invisible energies that are unable to exist by themselves without these Vessels or _Copas_ that hold them.
Regardless of what exactly it is that animates a vessel, the term lifeforce is used to refer to it.

An Initiate to this Mystery can sense when an action they are about to take is dangerous, hurtful or impossible in their current state. With the appropriate rite, they can empower and attune their body to make the task possible and safe, or force their own Soul to briefly leave their body to explore the Mysteries unhindered.


## Trait: Mage Time

When something in your vicinity __will hinder or endanger you__, the MC tells you what's going to happen. 
If you don't like that result you may perform a single rite, just in time to change the outcome.


## Spell: Channelling

When you perform an __channelling rite__ upon yourself or another subject, __roll +Copas__.
__On a 7+__, gain or grant one benefit for an hour.
__On a 10+__, you can gain or grant two benefits at once, or one benefit for one day. 

* Become skilled in a task, such as playing an instrument, hacking, picking locks, juggling, etc.
* Become able to jump, throw or run a long distance in a short time, better than any athlete.
* Become resistant to something that would harm, change or bind the subject.
* Obtain a supernatural ability from a component used in the enhancement rite.
* Perform astral projection or interact with ephemeral entities.
* Improve the healing factor, or transfer lifeforce into a subject.

__On a miss__, choose one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

Whenever this mystery grants skills, traits or properties, the subject that receives controls them.


### Channelling Rites

The following are common channelling rites:

* Imbibe a substance that alters your perception or state of mind.
* Prepare and consuming something a ceremonial meal. 
* Perform some manner of ritual purification of the body.
* Complete a kata, mantra, dance, breathing excercise or similar.
* Meditate on a secluded, tranquil, dark space.
* Don a sacred outfit or costume and wield purified or consacrated tools.


### Supernatural Abilities

This Mystery will not grant the Initiate supernatural abilities unless specific components are used in the rite. 
These special components, that are very often supernatural in origin, can be discovered through trial and error or learned from Grimoires and Masters. 
Once a component is discovered, you may write it down so that you can use it in the future.

### Astral Projection

When you perform Astral Projection, your Mind and Soul exit your body and behave like an ephemeral entity. 
Your body goes limp and enters a state of suspended animation while your Mind continues to sense the material plane around it, with your body serving as an anchor.
Your projection can levitate and go through solid surfaces in the material plane.

You can also choose to project to other nearby realms, such as the Astral planes which can be entered anywhere. 

### Magical Vampirism

When a creature does something to accumulate a powerful supernatural trait, their vessel may become cracked and leak lifeforce. 
This condition can be spread through dark rites and curses, and forces the subject to constantly consume the lifeforce of other still-living creatures of their kind, to sustain themselves and their powers. 
There are many kinds and strains of vampires: The subject may become stronger, smarter, more beautiful, psychic or even immortal.

### Healing Factors

This Mystery can help a subject heald much faster from a wound, as well as provide medical training to an Initiate.
This can raise the rate of healing by a factor, greatly reducing healing time. 
Many non-critical wounds can be healed this way over a single day of rest. 

However, the magic of the Vessels cannot instantly heal, or heal wounds and diseases that would just get worse over time, unless a source of equivalent lifeforce is spent in the spell. 
In that case, the Mystery can channel the existing lifeforce into the vessel to perform miraclous healing.
