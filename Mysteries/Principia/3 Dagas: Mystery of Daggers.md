# Dagas: Mystery of Daggers

__Traits:__ Consecration. __Spell:__ Power Word.

The Mystery of Daggers teaches us that any entity can enforce its will upon another without direct interaction. 
Words and tools are used to channel and amplify the will and force a desired response. 
The end result of using this words and tools is vastly more powerful than any direct effort. 

Any Initiate of this Mystery learns to build an Object of Power for themselves that they can later use to issue commands. 
They can also create pacts and contracts with that allows their will to be enforced over a longer period of time. 


## Trait: Consecration

You have an _Object of Power_ which is typically some kind of wand, stave, staff, weapon, orb or talisman. 
The Object must have something unique to it, and be attuned to your own personality and sensibilities. 
You have magical sympathy towards the Object and viceversa. 

When you perform a __consecration rite__ upon an object that meets the requirements, it becomes your Object of Power.


### Consecration Rites

The following are common consecration rites:

* Perform a ceremony in which the object is metaphisically bound to you.
* Practice using the object over and over until you learn all its secrets.


## Spell: Power Word 

When you __point your Object of Power at a subject, or offer a sacrament, and utter a request__, __roll +Dagas__. 
__On a 10+__, the subject fulfills your request to the best of its ability.
__On a 7+__, the subject will only fulfill your request if you accept to form a _contract_ with it. 
__On a miss__, something goes wrong and the entity doesn't want to cooperate, __gain insight__.

Any mind, program or supernatural entity in a body of any kind can be "suppresed" as the request, causing the entity to enter a deep slumber until the enchantment is removed.


### Offering a Sacrament

A sacrament involves sacrificing something that a subject would consider valuable. 
Burning incense, spilling a drink or giving a splash of blood are good common sacraments. 
Powerful entities may require unique or rare sacraments.
Sacraments are only needed when the Object of Power cannot be used to point at the subject. 

### Forming a Contract

To form a basic contract the Mage makes a request, and the other entity declares a condition. 
The Initiate can volunteer a service if the entity doesn't have a specific condition that it wants.
The condition _must_ be something of equal or less value than the original request, and not impossible.
If both parties agree, the contract is formed and creates sympathy between the parties. 

If a contract is broken, something goes wrong: the MC decides what happens. 

### Awaken and Asleep

When you hit with a 10, you can command the subject to fall asleep or awaken instantly. This can be used to awaken a spirit or ephemeral entity sealed or asleep within a vessel. A living creature can be made to enter a deep sleep until they are woken up by an external force, such as being shaken vigorously or splashed with water. An ephemeral entity made to sleep will retreat into its anchor for a few hours, days, or months depending on the situation.
