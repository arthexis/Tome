# Dagas: Mystery of Daggers

The Mystery of Daggers teaches us that any entity can enforce its will upon another without direct interaction. 
Words and tools are used to channel and amplify the will and force a desired response. 
The end result of using this words and tools is vastly more powerful than any direct effort. 

Any Initiate of this Mystery learns to build an Object of Power for themselves that they can later use to issue commands. 
They can also create pacts and contracts with that allows their will to be enforced over a longer period of time. 


## Move: Power Object

You have an Object of Power which is typically some kind of wand, stave, staff, weapon, orb or talisman. 
The Object must have something unique to it, and be attuned to your own personality and sensibilities. 
You have magical sympathy towards this object and viceversa. 

When your Object of Power is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one by performing a _consecration rite_ upon another object that meets the requirements. 

### Consecration Rite

The following are common consecration rites:

* Perform a ceremony in which the object is metaphisically bound to you.
* Practice using the object over and over until you learn all its secrets.


## Move: Power Word 

When you __point your Object of Power at a thing or offer it a sacrament, and then utter a request it can understand__, __roll +Dagas__. 
__On a 10+__, it fulfills your request to the best of its ability.
__On a 7+__, it will only fulfill your request if you accept to form a _contract_ with it. 
__On a miss__, something goes wrong and the entity doesn't want to cooperate, __mark experience__.

### Offering a Sacrament

An appropriate sacrament involves sacrificing something of value that another entity would appreciate as a gift. 
In general, burning incense, spilling a drink and giving a drop of blood is a good sacrament for a simple request. 
Powerful entities may require unique sacraments.
Sacraments are only needed when the Object of Power cannot be used, for example if it is not posible to point at the entity. 

### Forming a Contract

To form a basic contract the Mage makes a request, and the other entity declares a condition. 
The condition _must_ be something that requires less effort than the original request, and must be something that the Mage is actually capable of providing.
The Initiate can volunteer a service if the entity doesn't have a specific condition that it wants.
If both parties agree to the request and conditions, the contract is formed. 
A bond of magical sympathy forms between the parties. 

If the contract is broken, something goes wrong: the MC decides what happens.
