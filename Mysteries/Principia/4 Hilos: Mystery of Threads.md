# Hilos: Mystery of Threads

The Mystery of Threads teaches us that freedom is too an illusion: everything is conected and relative to another, and the mutual bondage between all things creates the framework that allows objective reality both to stabilize and change. 

An Initiate can sense the invisible sympathies connecting all things. 
With the proper rites, the connections can be tightened or loosened, invisibly affecting the relationships between things.

### Magical Sympathy

Using this Mystery requires, creates or destroys magical sympathy between two things. 
This sympathy exists only between things that satisfy at least one of the following:

* They are in physical contact right now.
* They have a strong emotional relationship or blood bond.
* One thing was part of the other thing for a long time.
* They are bound together by a supernatural power.


## Move: Binding

When you perform a __binding rite__ on yourself or another subject, __roll +Hilos__. 
__On a 7+__, choose one.
__On a 10+__, you also __take +1__ on the next rite you perform upon the subject.

* Transfer its magical sympathy to another subject of your rite.
* The next magical effect used on the subject is channeled to another subject that it has sympathy with.
* Create magical sympathy between it and another subject close to it.
* Turn it into an anchor for an ephemeral entity that has sympathy with it.
* Create a Ward and/or Seal upon a place or container that lasts until disrupted. 

__On a miss__, choose one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

### Binding Rites

The following are common binding rites:

* Burn or break the subject, scattering the remains to the wind.
* Repeatedly Tie, weave, braid, mix or knot a thread around the subject.
* Inscribe the subject with magical symbols.
* Place the thing in bondage or enclose it with magical geometry.
* Utter the sacred name that defines the other thing.

### Anchors

If something is affected by an enchantment, such as an illusion, the enchanted object has sympathy towards the enchanter. 
If this sympathy is broken, the enchantment ends. 

Similarly, ephemeral entities that cannot stay in the material plane can anchor themselves to objects, creatures and places.
This creates a potent sympathy with their anchor. 
If the anchor or the sympathy is broken, the entity will cease to exist or return to their origin realm.

### Seals and Wards

A Ward is a space protected from any outside influence that depends on magical sympathy. 
This means supernatural powers cannot be used to enter or scry into the space or container.

A Seal is the same but backwards: it prevents magical forces from leaving.
