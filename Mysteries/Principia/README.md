# The Tetragram of Power

Each magus must become an Initiatie in at least four basic _Principia_ of Magic. 
These four Mysteries are also collectivelly known as the Tetragram of Power, the Squared Circle or the Sacred Cardinal:

- Velos: Mystery of Shrouds
- Copas: Mystery of Vessels
- Hilos: Mystery of Threads 
- Dagas: Mystery of Daggers

As the Initiate's understanding of each Mystery in the Square increases, they will become able to 
combine them into complex rituals to achieve more advanced Magics.
