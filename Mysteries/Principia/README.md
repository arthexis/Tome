# The Tetragram of Power

Each magus must become an Initiatie in at least four basic _Principia_ of Magic. 
These four Mysteries are also collectivelly known as the Tetragram of Power, the Squared Circle or the Sacred Cardinal.

They are listed in order of complexity:

* Velos: Mystery of Shrouds
* Copas: Mystery of Vessels
* Dagas: Mystery of Daggers
* Hilos: Mystery of Threads 

As the Initiate's understanding of each Mystery in the Square increases, they will become able to combine them into complex rituals to achieve more advanced Magics.


## Using Magic: Moves

Each of the Principia empowers two or three distinct __Moves__. 
Each Move is a magical trigger or a simple cantrip, charm or trick that can be performed with only a quick rite. 
The type of rite required depends on which Move is being used. 

The 10 Moves available to all Mages using only the Four Principia are:

1. Unseen Sense (Velos)
1. Revelation (Velos)
1. Occultation (Velos)
1. Mage Time (Copas)
1. Channelling (Copas)
1. Consecration (Dagas)
1. Power Word (Dagas)
1. Binding (Hilos)


### Rolling Dice

Some Moves require dice to be rolled to determine the outcome: Roll two six-sided dice and add your score in the Principia being used.

* A result of 7 or more is a hit: the magic works as expected. 
* A result of 10 or more gains you an extra benefit, on top of the basic hit.
* A result of 6 or less is a miss: something goes wrong, Corruption has taken a hold of your Magic and the MC tells you what happens.


### Formulae

Initiates can use more complex forms of Magic that go beyond the Four Principia. 
These High Rituals or Formulae, have far-reaching effects and are capable of great miracles. 
Complex Formulae are created by combining the basic Moves in specific orders. 

The Formulae section contains a list of the most common High Rituals that a Magus can learn. 
If a Magus has not yet learned one of them, they can do so from a Grimoire or Mentor. 
As soon as they have been learned, they can be used by any Magus.
