# The Tetragram of Power

Each magus must become an Initiatie in at least four basic _Principia_ of Magic. 
These four Mysteries are also collectivelly known as the Tetragram of Power, the Squared Circle or the Sacred Cardinal:

- Velos: Mystery of Shrouds
- Copas: Mystery of Vessels
- Hilos: Mystery of Threads 
- Dagas: Mystery of Daggers

As the Initiate's understanding of each Mystery in the Square increases, they will become able to combine them into complex rituals to achieve more advanced Magics.


## Using Magic: Moves

Each of the Principia empowers two or three distinct __Moves__. 
Each Move is a magical trigger or a simple cantrip, charm or trick that can be performed with only a quick rite. 
The type of rite required depends on which Move is being used. 

The 10 Moves available to all Mages using only the Four Principia are:

1. Unseen Sense (Velos)
1. Reveal Truth (Velos)
1. Craft Illusion (Velos)
1. Forked Path (Copas)
1. Empty Body (Copas)
1. Correspondence (Hilos)
1. Bind Together (Hilos)
1. Snap Apart (Hilos)
1. Power Object (Dagas)
1. Power Word (Dagas)


### Rolling Dice

Some Moves require dice to be rolled to determine the outcome: Roll two six-sided dice and add your score in the Principia being used.

* A result of 7 or more means the magic works as expected, and if its 10 or more you gain an extra benefit. 
* A result of 6 or less means something goes wrong: Corruption has taken a hold of the Magic and the MC tells you what happens.


### Formulae

On the other hand, Initiates ocasionally use more complex forms of Magic that go beyond the Four Principia. 
These High Rituals or Formulae, have far-reaching effects and are capable of great miracles. 
Complex Formulae are created by combining the Moves from the Four Principia and their rites in specific orders. 
Some even require special components or places of power, in order to unlock their full potential. 

The Formulae section contains a list of the most common High Rituals that a Magus can learn. 
If a Magus has not yet learned one of them, they can do so from a Grimoire or Mentor. 
As soon as they have been learned, they can be used by any Magus.
