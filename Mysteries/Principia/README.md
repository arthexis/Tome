# The Tetragram of Power

Each magus becomes an Initiatie in at least four basic _Principia_ of Magic. 
These four Mysteries are also collectivelly known as the Tetragram of Power, the Squared Circle or the Sacred Cardinal.

They are listed in order of complexity:

* Velos: Mystery of Shrouds
* Copas: Mystery of Vessels
* Dagas: Mystery of Daggers
* Hilos: Mystery of Threads 

As the Initiate's understanding of each Mystery in the Square increases, they will become able to combine them into complex rituals to achieve more advanced Magics.


## Using Magic: Spells

Each of the Principia enables the use one or more basic _spells_ and _traits_. 

* __Traits__ are innate magical properties that the Initiate benefits from.
* __Spells__ are flexible magical effects that can be triggered by performing a rite. 

The 5 basic spells available to all Mages using only the Four Principia individually are:

1. Revelation (Velos)
1. Occultation (Velos)
1. Channelling (Copas)
1. Power Word (Dagas)
1. Binding (Hilos)

The 3 traits all Mages obtain from the Principia are:

1. Unseen Sense (Velos)
1. Mage Time (Copas)
1. Consecration (Dagas)


### Rolling Dice

Many spells require dice to be rolled to determine the outcome.
If required, roll two six-sided dice and add your score in the Principia being used.

* On 7 or more is a hit: the spell works as expected. 
* On 10 or more you gain an extra benefit, on top of the basic hit.
* On 6 or less is a miss: something goes wrong, the MC tells you what.

When something says that you __take +X__ in a roll, it means you add X to the roll before determining the result.


### Formulae

Initiates can use more complex spells that go beyond the Four Principia. 
These High Rituals or __Formulae__, have far-reaching effects and are capable of great miracles. 
Complex Formulae are created by combining the basic Moves in specific orders. 

The Formulae section contains a list of the most common High Rituals that a Magus can learn.
