# The Labyrinth

The realm known as the Labyrinth is a colossal network of tunnels, mazes, twisting corridors, hedges, caves, bridges and all sorts of labyrinthine structures cobbled together.

## Thresholds

Wherever there is a physical door, arch, gap or trap, there is an entrance to the Labyrinth.
An Initiate merely needs to cast __Revelation__ on any potential entrance while presenting their _Object of Power_ to reveal the Labyrinth on the other side.
As soon as the door is closed, or after a few minutes if its left open, the Threshold vanishes and returns to normal.
A Threshold may also be opened by an entity exiting the Labyrinth. 

## Rules

Gravity can work differently in the Labyrinth, as some spaces have walkable walls and ceilings. 
Space certainly works differently, as sections of the Labyrinth can have portals to distant sections, or even trap visitors in a loop. 

An Initiate traversing the Labyrinth can use __Binding__ to find the nearest exit that would lead to a place or subject that they have sympathy with. 
Using this method of navigation, the Labyrinth can be used to bypass long distance travel. 
A round trip to a remote country could take minutes if the right exits and shortcuts can be found. 

However, without magic its almost impossible to find one's way through the Labyrinth, since many doors inside it just lead to other sections of the Labyrinth instead of back into the material plane. 

## Inhabitants

The Labyrinth is usually very lonely, with huge stretches devoid of any kind of intelligent life. 

__Guardian Beasts (Rank 2-3):__ The only known native inhabitants are known as Guardian Beasts. 
These massive animal-like creatures have human-level intelligence and physical features. 
They appear to guard certain sections of the Labyrinth to keep explorers away. 
Aside from their bulk and ferocity, they are able to manipulate space, allowing them to know the destination of every door and portal in the Labyrinth, and enabling them to squeeze through any opening, no matter how small.

__The Lost (Rank 1-2):__ It is not impossible for an unlucky human to accidentally enter the Labyrinth, or be lured into it. 
If they are unable to find their way out after some time, the Labyrinth starts to change them into animal-like creatures similar to Guardian Beasts.
These Lost souls are unable to return to their human forms, and cannot survive outside the Labyrinth without an anchor. 
Some of these Lost guide other visitors to save them from their fate, while others are eager to create more Lost just to have some company in the lonely depths of the Labyrinth.


## Lore

It is thought that the Labyrinth was constructed by ancient Mages, or that it is shaped by humanities desire to keep the supernatural far away.
