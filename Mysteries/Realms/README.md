# Realms

The term "Unseen Realms" refers to the supernatural spaces contained within reality that are out of reach for human minds and bodies.
These spaces contain alien landscapes and arcane rules that can obliterate or mutilate their visitors. 
Their Thresholds, the places where crossing over is possible, cannot be perceived or entered by humans unless magic or luck is involved.

Many realms contain mysteries that are of importance for Mages, and many more are still unexplored. 

__Planes:__ A plane is a collection of realms that follow similar rules.
Crossing from one realm to another is easier if they exist in the same plane. 
Mundane physical reality is sometimes refered to as the material plane, where each planet and star is a material realm.

__Domains:__ When a powerful entity establishes itself in a realm, it creates a domain. 
Many realms have a single domain, others have many or few, perhaps even none. 
While domains follow the rules of the realm, the nature of its master can modify it somewhat.
