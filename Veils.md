# The Mystery of Veils

The Mystery of Veils teaches us that everything perceived is veiled by myriad illusions. Indeed, our Mind's Eye has evolved not to operate on the Recondite Truth of objective reality, but upon the ilusions themselves. Some of these can dispelled by the tools of science and rationality, but others cannot be dispelled without proper knowledge of the Arcane Mysteries.

Any Initiate to this Mystery can use their intuition to discern aspects of the truth hidden under these Veils. With the proper rite, the Veils can be removed... or new Veils laid down to obscure the perception of the uninitiated.

## Move: Sense the Veil (Passive)
When __something supernatural ocurrs in your surroundings__ even if you are unable to perceive it normally, you feel it in your Soul. The MC might ask you a question, and then tells you what you sense and how you sense it.

## Move: Part the Veil (Active)

When __something is hidden, unclear or deceitful__, and you perform a _revelation rite_, __roll +Veils__. __On a 7+__, the MC answers one question. __On a 10+__, the answer two.

- Where is something hidden?
- What is here that cannot be perceived?
- Who here is being deceitful?
- How does this thing work?
- When did something happen?

__On a miss__, ask one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

### Revelation Rites

The following are common revelation rites:

- Looking at something through a crystal, lens or reflection.
- Praying to a higher power for insight or wisdom.
- Interpreting signs and omens in natural phenomena. 
- Consulting the results of a game of chance.

## Move: Draw the Veil (Inverted)

When you __want to magically hide or disguise something__ by performing an _occultation rite_, __roll +Veils__. __On a hit__, choose one or two options:

- It's appearance changes to something that is similar.
- Others avoid paying attention to it, if they are able.
- It leaves no tracks or record of its passing.

__On a 10+__, the illusion lasts for as long as needed and is very precise. __On a 7+__, the illusion lasts just a short moment or is not very accurate, MC's choice. 
__On a miss__, choose one anyways but something goes wrong, __mark experience__.

Occultation Rites:

- Hiding something under a veil or inside an opaque container.
- Use smoke, dust, fog, shadows or lights to obscure something.
- Burying something or destroying evdicence of its existence.
